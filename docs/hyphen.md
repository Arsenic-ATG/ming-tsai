Hi, I'm Ming Tsai. I'm a software engineer with 4 years of experience in frontend and backend development, software architecture, DevOps, and Agile methodology.

My last project is a platform that helps the teams to follow up the data integration.

The frontend is developed with Vue Js, using Buefy as UI components and Jest as unit testing.
The backend is developed with DotNet Core and a bot that is written on Typescript.

The technology we use are:
- EF Core for reading the database that is on Sql Server.
- REST for API architectural style.
- Azure DevOps for configuring the CD/CI.
- Git for managing controller version.
- Docker for containerization.
- NUnit for testing the code.
- The bot we created is using to identifying the data integration and make action when found error on data integrity.

We are using the Null object and Dependency Injection for software design pattern and using the Clean Code for the coding styles.
For project management on this project, we are using Scrum.

My biggest challenge to date is creating an App made on Xamarin + Firebase to send house maintenance services.
The frontend is made on Xamarin Android for house owners and Windows forms for officer.
The backend is made on Dotnet Core.

The technology I use is:
- Firebase for database and user identity.
- App Center to log the user events and releasing the App.
- Telerik for UI components.
- Google API in account and maps manager.
- REST for API architectural style.
- NUnit to test the backend code.

I used the Dependency Injection for software design pattern and using the Clean Code for the my coding styles.

My others skills:
- Kanban agile methodology.
- GraphQL
- MySql
- Oracle
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- SOLID
- SignalR
- Redis
